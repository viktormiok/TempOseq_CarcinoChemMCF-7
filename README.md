# Scope

Differential gene expression and pathway analysis of MCF-7 cell lines exposed to multiple chemicals belong to specific chemical classes at different doses under estrogen starved and treated conditions employing breast cancer panel targeting 500 genes using TempO-Seq platform and a targeted gene expression panel, Breast Carcinogen Screen (BCScreen).

The aim of the study is to identify mechanisms of potential breast carcinogens using targeted expression profiling, differential expression and pathway analysis.
